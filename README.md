Multilingual Voice Control of Automative Equipment's

Multilingual Voice Control of Automotive Equipments
Overview
This project implements a multilingual voice control system for automotive equipment using IoT technology. By utilizing OpenAI services for translation and a Raspberry Pi for controlling car functions, this system allows users to control various automotive components using voice commands in multiple languages.

Features
Multilingual Support: Accepts voice commands in various languages and translates them using OpenAI's translation services.
Voice Recognition: Uses speech recognition to capture and process voice commands.
Raspberry Pi Integration: Utilizes a Raspberry Pi to interface with and control automotive equipment.
Automotive Control: Enables control of car functionalities such as lights, locks, and other electronic components.
Components
OpenAI API: For language translation and natural language processing.
Raspberry Pi: Serves as the central controller for automotive equipment.
Microphone: Captures voice commands from the user.
Automotive Interface: Connects the Raspberry Pi to the car's electronic systems.
